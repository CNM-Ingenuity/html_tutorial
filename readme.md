Kip DeCastro

## Instructions

There are 24 html files in this repository. Clone it and fill each file with
the code from https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp . Do not copy and
paste the code. It is important that you write each line. Make sure the code
works in your browser (just open the file).

The final portion of this tutorial will be to construct a personal website
using what you've learned, including css.
